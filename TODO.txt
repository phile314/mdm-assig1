    Basic stuff (reading file)
    Generating candidate (gini index, minLeaf filtering)
PH  Functional tree-growing
MV  R-way of tree-growing

  Only split between consecutive rows with different class (optimization)
  Comparing performance
  Fix case with only 1 attribute

Notes
  When searching the best split, the segment border optimization cannot be 
  used if the leafmin constraint is active.

Questions
  Efficient partitioning
  Duplicate removal (I really think so)
  We only pick up the best of best of each attribute:
    Is the right thing to do?
  Dealing with binary attributes
  X is a matrix. Is it allowed to have only one  attribute (only one column)
    I suppose so ...
