    (Fix case with only 1 attribute)
    Fix best_split for binary attributes
PH  Functional tree-growing
MV  R-way of tree-growing
    Test with simple example files

  Only split between consecutive rows with different class (optimization)
  Comparing performance

Notes
  When searching the best split, the segment border optimization cannot be 
  used if the leafmin constraint is active.

Questions
  Efficient partitioning
  Duplicate removal (I really think so)
  We only pick up the best of best of each attribute:
    Is the right thing to do?
  Dealing with binary attributes
  X is a matrix. Is it allowed to have only one  attribute (only one column)
    I suppose so ...
  Ask about corner case: Splits that do not improve the impurity might create
  leaves that have the same label. Is this sensible? Or should we enforce that
  they predict two different class labels.
